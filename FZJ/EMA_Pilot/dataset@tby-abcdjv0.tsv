title	JTrack EMA Pilot					
description	In a pilot study, data was collected from 21 participants to compare remote passive monitoring (using the JTrack Social application) to self-reporting (using the JTrack EMA application) of social behavior through smartphone-based assessments. Over a period of two weeks, all participants were asked to report daily on their behavioral and mood perceptions from the previous day. This data can be used to evaluate the correlation between passive sensor-based recordings and self-reported measures of social and health-related behavioral patterns.
